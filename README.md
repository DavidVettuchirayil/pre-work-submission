# Pre-work - _Memory Game_

Memory Match It! is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program.

Submitted by: David Vettuchirayil

Time spent: 1.5 hours spent in total

Link to project: (https://glitch.com/edit/#!/flower-clammy-patio?path=README.md%3A7%3A15)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
- [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked.
- [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked.
- [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
- [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.
- [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
- [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
- [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
- [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
- [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
- [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
- [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
- [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
- [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
- [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
   [YOUR ANSWER HERE]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   [In terms of a challenge when doing this submission, there wasn't much in the way of doing things because of how detailed and specific
   the instructions were. I'd say if I were to attempt to do this project without such instructions it would be more challenging having not
   worked with such code beforehand. Although, the logic in implementation for the coding is very much similar to working in java so I'd imagine
   if I were to tackle it in a similar manner, it would be a somwhat-simplistic task. However, I do have to say that the implementation for the guess function
   was slighty annoying in managing the brackets for the nested loops, which took a couple of tries to get right. I wouldn't say that the implementation
   of the guess function was a little bit difficult as it took some thinking in working the variables I had been given to come out with the correct
   response. I did have some trouble during the nesting loops implementation where any guess attempted would cause a game over but I just managed to
   fix it by working the loops out starting from the top. Besides that there wasn't anything specific that was challenging for this submission.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   [My main question that comes immediately to my head as with any kind of programming job is where would a person, without having these instructions, start
   with a project such as this. These are a good amount of assets that are used and placed and I just wonder in a professional setting how either an individual
   or a team would first go about a project. Would it be something such as precuring everything such as the sounds and effects and focusing on implementing those by
   implementing the things they are used by or would it be moreso about working to create canvas where new ideas can be tried and thrown together to see what fits?
   I really want to know about how web developers work in teams together, if at all, and how they divide tasks and resources amongst themselves. I'm more interested
   in knowing about the individuals behind the projects than the project itself because to me that's all just coding. Although, I would like to know how people in
   web development create special effects for websites because I'm amazed by some of the things I see on websites like Nintendo's with animated characters and the
   little quirks they carry.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   [If I had more time for this project, and knew about it earlier, I would definitely want to attempt implementing some things such as having the boxes light up in a pattern either before or after
   the player starts. Another thing that I thought of when I implementing the sounds for the project was having a music mode because playing the sounds for the boxes very much
   reminds me of when I was a kid playing The Legend of Zelda and inputting directional commands to play the ocarina. With that train of thought, we could probably find a way to
   set certain pitches that the boxes play to real musical notes and create a sequence map from an mp3 file so you can create a playable tune sequence from it. I would definitely
   attempt to add a timer to the project with shorter playback time because I want a challenge. Also, since this is a fixed sequence, I very much would create a simple method to
   just make a randomized sequence instead.]
